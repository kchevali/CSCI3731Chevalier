### In Short
Fish ecosystem simulator with QT GUI in C++.

### Description
This is my final project for my undergraduate C++ course at HPU. I completed an object oriented program simulating fishes that can interact with each other and the environment. The program provides a 2D GUI built with QT and the user is able to see and interact with the fishes. Several fish types were implemented with varying levels of intelligence and different traits that divided into competing subspecies. Some interesting algorithms use include the boid flock algorithm and the quad tree algorithm (optimization). Some fish interactions include fish predation between species and fish breeding within species and other rules to make the simulation enjoyable to observe. The program also allows the user to add simple repelling forces to the fishes as well as neat visualizations of the quad tree algorithm and the perception of the largest fish in the simulation.
